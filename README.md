```

```javascript
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());

app.use(express.static("public"));
```

3.  GET route configuration to send data to the browser (the client)

4.  POST route configuration to save data in the server

> ### Client Side
